LD59 - Theme Signal & Machines
============================

Ludum Dare 59 Entry by Jimbly - "Title TBD"

* Play here: [dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD59/](http://www.dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD59/)
* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)

Acknowledgements:
* TODO

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)


TODO
====

Questions:
* Can we upgrade day length?  If not, then we need faster locomotion / cannons, or longer days and a way to skip
* Either is probably fine for MP, other people's drones just run out of power sooner

Additional recipes and resources (unique colored gems - spawn in half/quandrant near other players!)

Show recipes somewhere (just open a recipe book overlay?  tooltip on each resource?)

floaters look bad when two drones sell 2 things on the same frame, add an offset
Issue with a 2/4P game that you left showing up at top of list
Prune rooms with only a single user who left
Show finished state of games on room list - encourage user to resume a game that has been won but they haven't seen the victory for it yet (and save a high score when they do)
  Also some progress - encourage joining games with players actively playing
get default name for new anonymous account for scores local storage

Maybe
=====
* rate-limit sending diffs
* pause mode (continuous money in BG, just don't animate)
* button and hotkey to reset the day immediately (try doing this upon every placement near an actor?)
* undo/redo

Goal ~8 specific recipes?
fruit + ? = fruit
fruit + wood = beer
fruit + stone = jam (or fruit + fruit?)
wood + stone = fire
wood + ? = wood
stone + ? = stone

beer + fire = game
beer + stone = acid
jam + fruit = pie
game + jam = LD
