* Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

TODO
====

* Show finished state of games on room list - encourage user to resume a game that has been won but they haven't seen the victory for it yet (and save a high score when they do)
  *  Also some progress - encourage joining games with players actively playing

Maybe TODO
==========
* rate-limit sending diffs
* pause mode (continuous money in BG, just don't animate)
* button and hotkey to reset the day immediately (try doing this upon every placement near an actor?)
* undo/redo
